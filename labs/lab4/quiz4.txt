    f1: 3
    f1: 2
    f1: 1
    f1: 0
    f2: 0
    f2: 1
    f2: 2
    f2: 3

2)
    In f1, each frame prints the value of newX before creating the next frame
    in the recursive call. Because it is the last line in each frame, they
    are simply popped off until reaching main. In f2, each frame adds another
    before printing the value of newX in its frame, until the if check fails.
    Once x == 0, the added frames begin to pop off the stack until reaching
    main, printing the value of newX in each frame before popping off the 
    stack.
